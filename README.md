The following deep learning algorithms were utilized in this study: 
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A class of deep neural networks, most commonly 
applied to analyzing visual imagery. 
 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): A class of artificial neural networks where connections 
between nodes can create cycles, allowing information to persist. 
 Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP): A class of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of 
at least three layers of nodes. 
 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN architecture used in deep learning that has 
feedback connections, making it capable of processing not only single data points but also 
entire sequences of data.
